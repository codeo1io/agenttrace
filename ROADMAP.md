# agenttrace — Roadmap

> Autonomously maintained by the roadmap sync (reliability-first). Items cite reproducible codebase signals; acceptance is proven by cited evidence.

**Vision**: A reliable, customer-friendly repository advanced by evidence-cited roadmap cycles owned by the autonomy loop

**Pillars**: reliability work outranks customer-experience work; every roadmap item cites reproducible codebase signals; acceptance is proven by cited evidence, never claimed

## Fleet context

- dependents (changes here affect): (host), agent, maestro
- graph: evidence-derived (imports/refs/deploy surfaces); advisory

## Open items

### Add test coverage for 1 untested module(s)
- id: `rm-002` | track: reliability | priority: 83.0 | status: candidate
- signals: reliability.no_tests:scripts/fixtures/make-adversarial-sqlite.py
- acceptance: Every module in ['scripts/fixtures/make-adversarial-sqlite.py'] has a corresponding test file with at least one passing test
- evidence: full suite green (python -m pytest -q) at HEAD; conductor validation digest validation:v1:<sha> recorded in the shipping PR

### Refactor 3 high-complexity function(s)
- id: `rm-001` | track: reliability | priority: 79.0 | status: candidate
- signals: reliability.complexity_hot:npm/scripts/install.js::L24, reliability.complexity_hot:npm/scripts/install.js::L28, reliability.complexity_hot:npm/scripts/install.js::L40
- acceptance: Each flagged function is decomposed below the branch threshold with behavior locked by characterization tests
- evidence: ast-based branch-count check passes at HEAD (full suite green; conductor validation digest validation:v1:<sha> recorded in the shipping PR)
